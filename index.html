        <p><em>Best <strong>African</strong> Brawl Stars Gamer</em></p>
        <p>I have been playing <a href="https://supercell.com/en/games/brawlstars/">Brawl Stars</a> since the Global release in 2018. I must say times have been tough. I've witnessed many brawlers get re-worked and the meta change a lot, but I
          remained the best regardless.</p>

  <!-- You could have also chosen to nest the tables above
  to give it the same look. Do so by creating 2 tables. 1 from beginning to the
  tr after god Abilities star ratings. Then the second table from second tr to
  the end which is where 2 stars for BMing is.
  Next you now create a whole nother table (table 3), and create 1 tr with 2
  td. Put table 1 into td 1 and table 2 into td 2. And Voila! -->
